      <h2>About Rosa</h2>
      <p>Hi I'm Rosa and I have a real passion for Creative design, I'm never happier than when I'm pushing the envelope of what can be done with HTML and CSS

        I came into web design from an art background but soon realised that I needed to develop my technical skills as well. So I did a lot of online courses that pushed what I know, then used the support and experience of my colleagues to hone my skills.
        My work with Hot Beans has been very varied and I enjoy the challenge of not knowing what industry our next client will come from, it keeps me on my toes and my creativity fresh.
        
        I love working for HBW and they have been super supportive these are some of the things I do on a day to day basis:
        
        I take a lead role in maintaining and developing client's sites
        attend meetings with internal and external clients to plan and develop site content, style and appearance
        use web content management systems (CMS)
        analyse website usage statistics
        write reports for senior managers, clients and partnership organisations
        carry out quality assurance checks on content
        
        The part I enjoy most about my job is being both technical and creative it's the perfect mix.</p>
