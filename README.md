Justification how it met the client requirements:

client requirementes:

a profile of the company itself
profiles of existing trainee web developers
job specifications and required
an on line application form 
links to a web development courses


Target Audience:

The target audience for the site is people who have completed training courses or qualifications related to web development and are now looking for a job as a web developer.

Design and user experience: 

Design layout:

Regarding the design layout I opt to imitate a webpage which i done previous resaerch on called "ShineTechsoftware" I chose this website beacuse it had key elmentes which I deciede to implmnets to my own website creation furthermore thet website was also tech related which inpirated me more.However I did not only use the website i pointed out as my only inspiration I also desighed other aspects by justing trying and figuring out what looks good and goes well with the webpage.

Colour scheme choice:

Regarding The colour choice in the website i choose the background colour to be mainly green beacuse It matched the colour of the company logo, this also relates to the client requirements because I implemented and added the company's logo to my website.

What I use:


Typography:

Inter is a modern, clean informal that is optimised for screen reading, which is why i chose it for the body text.I choose Playfair display for the headlines in order to establish a distinct visual hierachy and add a little refinemnet and contrast.

What I used:



imagery:

Regarding the images used in the website all of them were already provided to me in the required files section in the classroom all I had to do was download and adjust their size and location when designing my website.In summary I downaled and inserted them to my website I did not use any external images.

Images used:

User experience(UX):

The simple and modern design of the website created with the user expreince and also client requiremnets in mind, made the website very easy to use, additionly the responsove features ensured a very smooth browsing expereince for any device that it is menat to be run on. Another aspect I would like to mention is where I got my inspiration from which was from another website which I had looked at.

Functionality and features:

The main reason that the website was produced was to meet the client requiremnets, the features include an informative webpages which explain each quiery that user wants with some pages contain detail if neccesary whereas other contain simple and self explnatory detail.
