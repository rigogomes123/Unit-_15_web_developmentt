# Introduction:

During My Hot Beans Web training, I've been asked to create a new page on the company site. The use of this page is to attract new web developers by showcasing the company, current trainees, job openings, and providing and online an online applicaion form. I'll also include links to useful web development courses. The peoject will involve creating and building the webpage, and refining it according to feedback. This will enable me to work on my web development skils while fullfilling the company's requirements for the recruitment potential employeees.

# Justification how it met the client requirements:

## client requirementes:

a profile of the company itself
profiles of existing trainee web developers
job specifications and required
an on line application form 
links to a web development courses


# Target Audience:

The target audience for the site is people who have completed training courses or qualifications related to web development and are now looking for a job as a web developer.

## Design and user experience: 

## Design layout:

Regarding the design layout I opt to imitate a webpage which i done previous resaerch on called "ShineTechsoftware" I chose this website beacuse it had key elmentes which I deciede to implmnets to my own website creation furthermore thet website was also tech related which inpirated me more.However I did not only use the website i pointed out as my only inspiration I also desighed other aspects by justing trying and figuring out what looks good and goes well with the webpage.

## Colour scheme choice:

Regarding The colour choice in the website i choose the background colour to be mainly green beacuse It matched the colour of the company logo, this also relates to the client requirements because I implemented and added the company's logo to my website. When it came to the colour of the text I only used black and white founts.

## Background colours i used (I decied to use 3 different shades of green):

## Background colour:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88b54260-9c45-4098-9aa6-7528283e0720)

## boarder colour:

## bottom-boarder colour:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61e33178-2fce-472a-b671-ddf0e5124222)


In summary I used 3 different shades of green in order to give a the whole website a stable way of structure, such as where each section is located at it being the begging and end for an example.



## Typography:

Inter is a modern, clean informal that is optimised for screen reading, which is why i chose it for the body text.I choose Playfair display for the headlines in order to establish a distinct visual hierachy and add a little refinemnet and contrast.

## What I used:

## imagery:

Regarding the images used in the website all of them were already provided to me in the required files section in the classroom all I had to do was download and adjust their size and location when designing my website.In summary I downaled and inserted them to my website I did not use any external images.

## Images used:

The simple and modern design of the website created with the user expreince and also client requiremnets in mind, made the website very easy to use, additionly the responsove features ensured a very smooth browsing expereince for any device that it is menat to be run on. Another aspect I would like to mention is where I got my inspiration from which was from another website which I had looked at.

## Functionality and features:

The main reason that the website was produced was to meet the client requiremnets, the features include an informative webpages which explain each quiery that user wants with some pages contain detail if neccesary whereas other contain simple and self explnatory detail.

# Optimisation:

Firstly for the optimisation step I decided to acknowledge the feedback I recevied from my classmates, the first feedback was to reduce the number of webpages, I had multiple webpages such as "Our Services", "Case Studies", "Careers", "Insights","About Us" and "Get in Touch". I removed all of those pages and just left "About Us" and "Careers" Pages this way it reduced the complixity on my website and make it simpler for user to naviage.

## Before:

## After:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5ab8c7b-3c9d-48a9-9e4a-b777ed264ee6)


Secoundly I recognised I mistake I had committed which was the name of one of the trainees I had spelled his name as "Leroy Daniel" and it should of have been "Daniel Leroy", Overall it was a quick and easy fix.

## Before:

## After:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8cb80a4-eb1d-4a2b-bd92-b0decd78925f)


Thirdly after receiving feedback from my secound classmate which I pointed out a clear requirement which I had left out which was to add links to web development course. Thankfully my classmate had picked this out and I had complete forgot to implment this to my other website,but however i mangaed to add to my last website.

## Before:

The learn webpage was not created at the time.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d93cbeb9-c307-4631-88a5-cbb67889800d)


## After:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85adaa04-7067-49ff-8216-665fa9b22859)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9732b208-a0f0-4b52-9124-f476400f4709)

The optimisation which I implemneted was the learn webpage with the features which I had missed out from the requiremenst files.I implemnest a HTML link which leads to The w3schools page so that the user can access and learn about html, I did the same thing for CSS Styling and JavaScript.

### Lastly Thank you page:


# Evaluation of the optimised design against the client requirements:

### introduction:

The design,development, and optimisation of the recently component of the Hot Beans Web company's website are all throughly and fairly assessed in this evaluation. The evaluation will cover how the optimised website meets client requirements.

### Design Evaluation:

The new website section's design priorutises user involvement and clarity. Among the important design concepts used are:

 #### responsiveness:

 Since the website is entirely responsive,it can be accessed on a variety of devices,such as smartphones,tablets, and PCs.

 #### Navigation:

 Users effortlessly navigate between parts, such as application forms, job ads, and company infomration, thanks to an easy to understand navigation framework.

 #### Brand Consistency:

The design complies to Hot Beans Web's branding, making good use of the company's colours,typography and logo placement.

#### Visual Hierachy:

In a logical and visually appealing way, the layout gives priority to the application form, job specifications, and trainee web developers profiles and the company profile

Areas for improvemnet incldue implementing a search bar engine which can enhacne resourcefulness and align with the site's goal of being able to attract qualified developers.

### Development Evaluation:

The development process include these standards.

HTML and CSS: The structure is semantically coreect with improved accessibility.

JavaScript Integration: I did not use javaScipt to its full exctend by i did in areas such as the online application form.

Back end Integration: Forms are connected to back end systm which can handle the data submission.

The absence of links to web development courses is a noticebale flaw that lessens the site's completeness even through the code is well structured. This feature would improve the site's ability to assist aspiring developers.

### Optimisation Evaluation:

To make sure that the performance is kept high, the following techniques were applied:

Imgage optimisation: All the images which I used were compressed without loss of quality in order to improve load times.

Additional webpage: I implemented a new webpage called learn which I used to meet a client requiremnet (add links to web developers course).

### Target Audience:

The main audience for this site are people who have finished web development training an are looking for work.This site effectively:

##### Highlits Growth:

The profiles of trainees developers enhace the care progression within Hot Beans Web.

#### Facilitates Application:

The online application form is able to make the whole application process much simpler.

#### Showcases Opportunities:

Cleaar avenues for applicants are provided by comprehensive job descriptions and credentials.


To ehnace appeeal, inetegrating the required which was to implement web development course links, by doing this the user can better their skills, and find what they are looking for.

## Comparison With Alternative Solutions

The newly updated section offers a more organised and interesting experience than the website's prior iteraction. The "Learn" section with connections with connections to web development courses, a crucial components of the present design, was absent from a last iteration. This improvemnets improves visitors upskilling while supporting Hot Beans Web's goal of encouraging learning and development among aspiring developers.

## Skills, performance, and Behabiour Reflection:

Effective time management, project planning, and flixibility were displayed throughout the undertaking. The project exceeded timelines and upheld quality requirements thanks to regular self evaluation and modifications. My technical abilities in front end programming were improved by the project, especiaalu in JavaScript functionality and responsive design. It also pointed out areas that needed work, like more thorough optimisation methods and smooth intergration of other resources.


## Conclusion:

Although the new Hot Beans Web section's design, optimisation are succesful, there is still opportunity for improvement. The site's performance and appeal to its target audience would be would be improved by fixing the lack of links to web development courses,putting deeper optimisation into practise, and taking into account more interactive features.


## show individual responsibility, effevtive time-mangement in your design(How I planned and manged time to meet targets):

To complete this activity I decided to create a gantt chart because it can set clear taks, each task is visually mapped out alongside a timeline. The chart displays start and end dates for each task, which enables to me plan ahead and allocate my time effectively.Futhermore it ehances progress tracking, as taks are completed i can mark them off on the Gantt chart, this can help in keeping track of what has been done and can also provide a great visual presentation. Overall I this was the best way show my resposibility and manage my time and planning effectively.

(The gantt chart is atteched to a folder called read_me_asset)

## How I revied and responded to outcomes including the use of feedback from other:

Regarding this activity I creare Google form questionnaire, because it provides a simple and effective platform to gather structure feedback, for reason such as:

###### Oragnised Feeback collection

###### Customised questions

###### Real time updates

###### Easy to share

###### Privacy and annymity.

Here is the Google form questionnaire i created:

#### Question 1:

#### Explanation:

I was able to gather organised replies that are simple to examine and evaluate by developing a through a Google Forms questionnaire. In order to better satisfy my intended gaoals, it also ofeered chances to get input from others, which cab be utilised to ehance the questionnaire, add clarifications, and make changes. I was able to recognise patterns, comprehend the users viewpoints, and evaluate the questions efficiency by going over the responses. Feedback was incorporated to gurantee that it was understandable, interesting and also succesful in obtaining the desired information.
