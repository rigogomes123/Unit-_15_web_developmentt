      <p>Hot Beans Web - Peterborough PE1
        £24,000 - £30,000 a year - Full-time, Permanent
        You'll be involved in the technical and graphical aspects of pages and will determine the look of the website as well as how it works. You may also be responsible for the maintenance of an existing site.
        The term web developer is sometimes used interchangeably with web designer, but this is misguided. Web developing is a more specialist role, focusing on the back-end development of a website, using programming languages to make the web design a reality that works well.
        The growth in touchscreen phones and tablet devices has dictated a new way of designing websites, with the web designer needing to ensure that web pages are responsive no matter what type of device is being used. Therefore, the need to test websites at different stages of design and on a variety of devices, has become an important aspect of the job.
        We are seeking a talented Web Designer to work with our team of programmers, and to join our ever-expanding creative team.</p>
